The Moon's shadow comes in from the right and leaves on the left, all while locations on Earth outside the umbral shadow -- over 100 kilometers away -- remain partly sunlit. During the next solar eclipse in mid-September, the Moon will, at most, block only part of the Sun.","media_type":"video","service_version":"v1","thumbnail_url":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/nTZQn19EwAU/0.jpg","title":"Through the Shadow of the Moon","url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTZQn19EwAU?rel=0&controls=0"},{"copyright":"David Forteza","date":"2015-04-15","explanation":"It's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning. More precisely, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the dusty stellar nurseries in which they formed. Located in the Carina Nebula and known informally as Mystic Mountain, these pillar's appearance is dominated by the dark dust even though it is composed mostly of clear hydrogen gas. Dust pillars such as these are actually much thinner than air and only appear as mountains due to relatively small amounts of opaque interstellar dust.  About 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, digitally reprocessed by an industrious amateur, and highlights an interior region of Carina which spans about three light years. Within a few million years, the stars will likely win out completely and the entire dust mountain will be destroyed.

In this sharp color composite image, the solo spira mirabilis seems to wind from a prominent ring of bluish, newborn star clusters and red tinted star forming regions. The odd galaxy also sports obscuring dust lanes a yellowish central bar structure composed of an older population of stars. NGC 4725 is over 100 thousand light-years across and lies 41 million light-years away in the well-groomed constellation Coma Berenices. Computer simulations of the formation of single spiral arms suggest that they can be either leading or trailing arms with respect to a galaxy's overall rotation. Also included in the frame, sporting a noticably more traditional spiral galaxy look, is a more distant background galaxy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1504/rNGC-4725-HaL(AOX)RGBpugh.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"One-Armed Spiral Galaxy NGC 4725","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1504/rNGC-4725-HaL(AOX)RGBpugh1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"Denis Priou","date":"2015-04-17","explanation":"Galactic or open star clusters are young. These swarms of stars are born together near the plane of the Milky Way, but their numbers steadily dwindle as cluster members are ejected by galactic tides and gravitational interactions. In fact, this bright open cluster, known as M46, is around 300 million years young. It still contains a few hundred stars within a span of 30 light-years or so. Located about 5,000 light-years away toward the constellation Puppis, M46 also seems to contain contradictions to its youthful status. In this pretty starscape, the colorful, circular patch above and right of the center of M46 is the planetary nebula NGC 2438. Fainter still, a second planetary nebula, PK231+4.1, is identified by the box at the right and enlarged in the inset. Planetary nebulae are a brief, final phase in the life of a sun-like star a billion years old or more, whose central reservoir of hydrogen fuel has been exhausted. NGC 2438 is estimated to be only 3,000 light-years distant, though, and moves at a different speed than M46 cluster members. Along with its fainter cohort, planetary nebula NGC 2438 is likely only by chance appearing near our line-of-sight to the young stars of M46.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1504/Messier46DenisPRIOU.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M46 Plus Two","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1504/Messier46DenisPRIOU1024.jpg"},{"date":"2015-04-18","explanation":"One of the largest young craters on Mercury, 114 kilometer (71 mile) diameter Hokusai crater's bright rays are known to extend across much of the planet. But this mosaic of oblique views focuses on Hokusai close up, its sunlit central peaks, terraced crater walls, and frozen sea of impact melt on the crater's floor. The images were captured by the MESSENGER spacecraft. The first to orbit Mercury, since 2011 MESSENGER has conducted scientific explorations, including extensive imaging of the Solar System's innermost planet.

The rim of the blue galaxy pictured on the right is an immense ring-like structure 150,000 light years in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, massive stars.  That galaxy, AM 0644-741, is known as a  ring galaxy and was caused by an immense galaxy collision.  When galaxies collide, they pass through each other -- their individual stars rarely come into contact.  The ring-like shape is the result of the gravitational disruption caused by an entire small intruder galaxy passing through a large one.  When this happens, interstellar gas and dust become condensed, causing a wave of star formation to move out from the impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.  The intruder galaxy is just outside of the frame taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. This featured image was taken to commemorate the anniversary of Hubble's launch in 1990. Ring galaxy AM 0644-741 lies about 300 million light years away.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1504/Ring0644_hubble_3628.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Ring Galaxy AM 0644-741 from Hubble","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1504/Ring0644_hubble_960.jpg"},{"copyright":"Thanakrit Santikunaporn","date":"2015-04-20","explanation":"Going, going, gone.  That was the feeling in Svalbard, Norway last month during a total eclipse of the Sun by the Moon.  In the featured image, the eclipse was captured every three minutes and then digitally merged with a foreground frame taken from the same location. Visible in the foreground are numerous gawking eclipse seekers, some deploying pretty sophisticated cameras.  As the Moon and Sun moved together across the sky -- nearly horizontally from this far north -- an increasing fraction of the Sun appears covered by the Moon. In the central frame, the Moon's complete blockage of the disk of the Sun makes the immediate surroundings appear like night during the day. The exception is the Moon itself, which now appears surrounded by the expansive corona of the Sun.  Of course, about 2.5 minutes later, the surface of the Sun began to reappear.  The next total eclipse of the Sun will occur in 2016 March and be visible from Southeast Asia.
